            <p>Whether you are launching new social media channels, reviving old ones, or putting more time and energy into your current outlets, social media is a lot of work for any sized B2B company. Signing up for a social media account is free but the time and resources needed to successfully run it is not. However, there are a number of free resources available online that can help businesses save time and money in growing their social media presence.</p>
            <p>See below for a list of various free social media tools broken down by category:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#social"><p>Tools for managing social media accounts</p></a></li>
                <li><a href="#graphics"><p>Tools for creating graphics</p></a></li>
                <li><a href="#photos"><p>Free stock photography</p></a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="social">Tools for managing social media accounts</h2>
            <p>One of the first steps a B2B company can take to go from a reactive social media program to a proactive program is to implement a social media management tool. These tools usually include features that allow businesses to schedule social media posts for the future which can help teams save time.</p>
            <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/plans/free-account"><h3>Hoosuite</h3></a>

            <h2 id="graphics">Tools for creating graphics</h2>
